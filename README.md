# Pydantic BaseModel with Large Language Model (LLM) Integration

This repository contains a Python framework for integrating large language models (LLMs) with Pydantic's BaseModel. The framework aims to simplify the process of generating and validating model instances using LLMs, leveraging the power of natural language processing and the robustness of Pydantic's data validation and serialization capabilities.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: The framework provides a unified interface (`LargeLanguageModelBase`) for interacting with various LLM providers, enabling seamless integration of LLMs with Pydantic models.
- **Model Generation**: Utilize LLMs to generate instances of Pydantic models based on natural language prompts or descriptions.
- **Data Validation**: Leverage Pydantic's built-in data validation and serialization features to ensure the generated model instances conform to the defined schema.
- **Extensible Architecture**: New LLM providers or models can be easily added by implementing the abstract methods defined in the base class.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous communication with LLMs is supported through the `ask` and `async_ask` methods.
- **Message Observation**: A `BehaviorSubject` is provided to observe and respond to messages emitted by the LLM during the model generation process.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Define your Pydantic models and implement a concrete subclass of `LargeLanguageModelBase` for your desired LLM provider or model.
4. Use the implemented LLM class and the provided utilities to generate and validate model instances based on natural language prompts or descriptions.
